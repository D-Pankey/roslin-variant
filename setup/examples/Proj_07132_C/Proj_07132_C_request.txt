ProjectTitle: Mutation profiling from samples collected from POETIC clinical trials
ProjectDesc: POETIC is a consortium of 10 member institutions conducting early stage clinical trials in pediatric cancer patients (led by Tanya Trippett at MSKCC). Over the next several years, tissues collected from POETIC trials will be sent to the CMO for DNA sequencing (IMPACT and whole exome) and to laboratories at other member institutions for other correlative studies. Future studies performed by the CMO may include plasma cfDNA and exosomal DNA sequencing, and RNASeq.
