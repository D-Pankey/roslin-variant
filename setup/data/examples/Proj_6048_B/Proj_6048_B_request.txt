ProjectTitle: Bladder Organoids
ProjectDesc: Organoid lines were cultured from four bladder cancer patients at Columbia University. We will delineate how closely organoids model tumor samples from a genetic standpoint. We hope to see if there are any de novo or subclonal mutations which may have given an evolutionary advantage to a subpopulation of cells to grow in vitro.
